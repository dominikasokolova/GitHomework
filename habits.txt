1. To be effective at your work you need to be comfortable, healthy and for that it is important to get a good sleep, exercise after hours spent sitting in a chair, drink a lot of fluids and get some sunshine while taking a break. 
2. You should not lose sight of your goal or you will spend hours on unimportant things. 
3. Keep the code simple and consistent so even after a long time you will easily understand it and so will others. 
4. It is good to work in a clean environment where nothing disturbs you. Maybe play some music in the background. 
5.If you stay in your comfort zone you will not learn new things, at least not so effectively.
